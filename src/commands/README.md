# Commands

The commands modules are meant to be the 'bridge' between the VSCode UI and underlying CQL services.

Command operations

- are triggered by users interacting with the VSCode UI.
- are allowed to update the UI as needed
  - to inform the user of the operation status
  - show result from operations
- can use all windowing/logging capabilities provided by vscode
