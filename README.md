# Clinical Quality Language (CQL) for VSCode

Adds syntax highlighting, semantic (error) highlighting, and local execution for the HL7 Clinical Quality Language (CQL) to VS Code

## Quick Start

The [cqframework.cql](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cqframework.cql) extension has been published to the VS Code Marketplace, so the installation is simple. Just search for "Clinical Quality Language" in the marketplace and install the extension. It'll be activated once you open a .cql file.

This extension requires Java to be installed. It'll prompt you to install Java if required. For windows (or java errors) follow these [instructions](Windows_Install_Setup.md).

This project maintains a [User Guide](https://github.com/cqframework/vscode-cql/wiki/User-Guide) that provides detailed instructions on how to use the plugin to author and test CQL content.

## More About the Clinical Quality Language

The Clinical Quality Language (CQL) is a domain specific language for expressing
electronic clinical quality measures (eCQM) and clinical decision support rules
(CDS) in an author-friendly computable format. Find out more about CQL:

## Local Plugin Development

Install `npm`

Run `npm install` from the root

Run `npm run watch` from the root

Run the `debug` launch from VS Code

TIP: The cql-language-server that provides error highlighting is a Java project. It's also launched in debug mode when this VS Code extension is launched in debug mode, allowing you to attach a Java debugger as well. If you're simultaneously iterating on the cql-language-server, you can create a symlink to that Java artifact and changes will be picked up when VS Code restarts.

On linux:
`vscode-cql/dist/jars$ ln -s your-repo-home/cql-language-server/ls/service/target/cql-ls-service-1.5.8.jar cql-ls-service-1.5.8.jar`

Set your repo home directory and update the versions as needed.

## Versioning

This project follows the guidance given by Microsoft for the VS Code marketplace [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_63#_publishing-prerelease-extensions) and publishes prereleases to the VS Code marketplace using odd minor version numbers. Full releases are published using even minor version numbers.

## Release Process

1. Update master to be a release version (and all the reviews, bug fixes, etc. that that requires)
    1. Update package.json - version to X.X.X (e.g. `0.7.7`)
2. Passed CI Build = ready for release
3. Follow the instructions here [Publishing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension) to publish the extension.
4. Create a github release (specify a tag of `vX.X.X` (e.g. `v0.7.7`) pointing at master to be created on release)
    1. Choose the "Auto-generate release notes" option
    2. Provide any additional detail/cleanup on the release notes
5. Update masster version to the next snapshot version `X.X.X-SNAPSHOT` (e.g. 0.7.8-SNAPSHOT)
6. Close all issues included in the release

## Acknowledgements

This plugin is a reimplementation of much of the functionality in the [atom_cql_support](https://github.com/cqframework/atom_cql_support) plugin for the Atom editor. Additionally, the Red Hat [vscode-java](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java) plugin was referenced extensively in developing this plugin.
